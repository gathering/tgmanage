== Usage

Depdencies are stored in `pyproject.toml` and can be used with e.g. poetry:

Install dependencies: `poetry install`

Run the script: `poetry run python script.py`

or `poetry shell` to have a configured shell you can run python from.

== Koblingsplan to Netbox

Get yourself a NetBox API token from here: `{ NETBOX_URL }/user/api-tokens/`
And expose it to the script (e.g. `export NETBOX_API_KEY=...token here ...`).
